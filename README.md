# PyBot-v2.0

PyBot is a Discord bot that runs Python code from Discord through Replit! The bot writes your code onto a Python file and then executes it, saving anything that was printed onto the terminal. The bot has many limitations such as time and while loops and anything that interacts with the screen such as tkinter, selenium, and turtle will obviously not work.

The bot has the following features:

- Code compiling capabilities
- Script saving (Through Replit db)
- Package searcher
- Snippet searching (Through Code Grepper)

The bot can save your code snippets for you to run and retrieve any time! The bot searches for code snippet on Code Grepper and searches for packages using PyPi.
